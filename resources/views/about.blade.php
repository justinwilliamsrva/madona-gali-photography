                        <p class="text-lg mb-5 text-gray-500">I'm Madona, and I am passionate about using photography to bring others together in making joyful, lasting memories and images! I'm originally from Egypt, but have called Richmond, VA home for the past 20 years. My perfect day starts with a cup of coffee; includes catching my breath running after my two sons; trying out a new recipe and nailing it makes the day even better; because we just LOVE food and ends with spending time with my favorite peopleâ€”my husband, family, and friends!</p>
                        <p class="text-lg mb-5 text-gray-500">I see beauty in the world all around me, and especially in the clients I have the privilege to work with. It is my great joy to help others see and discover that beauty in their own lives and families.  As your photographer, I seek to draw out the delight in your connections with those you love, so that we can create photos of those sweet moments for you to enjoy the rest of your life!</p>
                        <p class="text-lg mb-5 text-gray-500">I am a documentary portrait and wedding photographer primarily serving the Richmond, Virginia area; however, I am always up for a collaboration or a fun destination venue. Specializing in weddings, engagements, senior, maternity, family portraits and real estate photography, I am delighted at the opportunity to work with you!</p>
                        <p class="text-lg mb-5 text-gray-500">Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, and I am thrilled to meet and work with you. Let's make some beautiful memories and preserve them forever in photos!</p>
                        <p class="text-lg mb-5 text-gray-500">Joyfully, </p>
                        <p class="text-xl ml-12 text-gray-500">Madona</p>
